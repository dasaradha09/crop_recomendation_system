# crop Recomendation System

## **Description**
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that provides recommendations for suitable crops based on various environmental and soil conditions. It aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in making informed decisions about crop selection, optimizing yields, and maximizing profitability.

The system takes into account several factors such as soil type, climate, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and pH levels to determine the most suitable crops for a given region. By analyzing historical data and using predictive models, the system provides personalized recommendations tailored to the specific conditions of a farm or agricultural area.
